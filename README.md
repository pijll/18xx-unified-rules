This project contains the rules of several games in the 18xx genre.

The aim of this project is to provide these rules in a format
that can be used to extract the differences between the rules of two games,
using a standard tool such as diff.

To make this work, the rules have been written in a consistent order,
using the same phrasing and vocabulary where possible.
