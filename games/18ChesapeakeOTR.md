# 18Chesapeake Off The Rails

## Private Companies

The private companies P1 to P4
block the placement of track tiles
in a hex or a number of hexes
as long as they are owned by a player.

When the first 5 train is bought,
all private companies close.

P2 and P3:
The owning company may place tiles in the associated hexes
as an additional action.
This action may only be used if both hexes are empty.
Only tiles #8 en #9 may be used,
and the tiles must connect to each other.

P4:
The owning company may place a tile in its associated hex.
This counts as the company's tile lay action for the turn.
Terrain cost must be paid.
After the tile has been laid,
the company may place a token on the tile
for free.
This counts as the company's token placement for the turn.

P5:
The purchaser of this private company receives one share of the B&O.

P6:
The purchaser of this private company receives
the president's share of the associated railroad company
(chosen at random before the game).
This private company closes when the railroad company buys its first train.
This private company may not be bought by a railroad company.

### Distribution

In player order,
a player may
* buy the available private company with the lowest face value
* place an advance bid on another private company
* pass

When all players pass while the lowest value private company is still available,
the value of that company is lowered by 5,
and the private company auction continues.

When all players pass while any other private company is still available,
there is an Operating Round,
after which the private company auction continues.

## Stock Dealing Rounds

During their turn,
a player can take the following actions, in order (all optional):
* sell certificates
* either start a company,
or buy one share
* sell certificates

### Buying

When buying a share from the IPO,
the player pays the par value
to the bank.

When buying a share from the open market,
the player pays the current market value
to the bank.

A player may own up to 60% of the shares of a company.

When the share value of the company is in the orange or brown zone on the market,
a player may own up to 100% of the shares.

When the share value of the company is in the brown zone on the market,
a player may buy mutiple shares in one turn,
both from the IPO and the open market.

A player may not buy a share of a company
of which they have sold a share earlier this SDR.

### Selling

Players may not sell shares
during the first SDR.

The president's share may not be sold to the open market.
The open market may hold up to 50% of the shares of a company.

When a player sells shares,
the share value of the company moves 1 space down for each 10% sold.

### Certificate limit

A player may not buy a share that would take them
over the certificate limit.

If a player owns more certificates than the certificate limit,
they must sell shares until they comply with the certificate limit
in their next SDR turn.

Shares in companies with a share value in the yellow zone on the market
do not count towards the certificate limit.

Private company certificates
count towards the certificate limit.

### Starting a company

To start a company,
a player buys the president's certificate of a company.
The player chooses the par value of the company
from the options indicated on the stock market chart.

After the president's certificate has been bought,
the other shares are available.

A railroad company floats immediately
when 50% of the shares has been sold from the IPO.
The company receives 10 times the par value.
The home token is placed
at the start of the company's turn in the next operating round.

### Presidentship

If at any time a player has more shares of a company
than that company's president,
they become the president of that company.

They exchange two share certificates for the president's certificate,
and receive the company charter.

If two players have more shares than the president,
and have an equal number of shares,
the first player in player order after the former president
becomes the new president.

### End of SDR

The SDR ends when
all players pass
in consecutive turns.

The share value of a company moves up 1 space
if the shares of the company are sold out both in IPO and in the open market.

The player left of the last player to sell or buy a certificate
receives the priority deal.

## Operating Rounds

The number of operating rounds
is determined at the start of each set of ORs
and depends on the train phase.

### Order of Play

First,
the private companies pay out their dividends
to their owners.

Then, the railroad companies operate in order:
* from high to low share value
* right to left on the stock market
* top to bottom in a stack on one stock market cell

### Railroad Company Operations

During its turn,
a company can take the following actions, in order:
* Lay track
* Place a token
* Run trains
* Pay dividends
* Buy trains

After the first 3 train has been bought,
at any time during a company's turn in an OR,
the company may buy a private company
from a player
for a value of at least 1,
up to 2 times face value.

#### Lay Track

Each turn, a company may
either place one yellow tile
or upgrade one tile.

Track may not run off the hex grid
or into a blank side of a pre-printed hex that cannot be upgraded.

##### Placing Tiles

When placing a yellow tile,
there must be a route
from one of the company's tokens
to any track on that tile.

When placing a tile on a hex
that contains a terrain cost,
the company must pay that cost to the bank.

Yellow basic track tiles are unlimited.

##### Upgrading Tiles

A yellow tile may be upgraded to a green tile
after the first 3 train has been bought.
A green tile may be upgraded to a brown tile
after the first 5 train has been bought.
A brown tile may be upgraded to a grey tile
after the first D train has been bought.

When a tile is upgraded, all existing connections must be maintained.

When upgrading a tile that does not contain a city or town,
there must be a route
from one of the company's tokens
to any new track on the new tile.

When upgrading a tile that contains a city or town,
there must be a route
from one of the company's tokens
to any track on the new tile.

Placing a green tile on a yellow pre-printed hex
counts as upgrading a tile.
If the hex contains a terrain cost,
the company must pay that cost to the bank.

#### Place Token

Each turn, a company may place one token
in a free station circle.

There must be a route
from one of the company's tokens
to that circle.

A company may not own multiple tokens
on the same hex.

#### Run Trains

Each train may run a route of at least two revenue locations.

A route must include at least one token of the company.

A route can visit but cannot pass through
a city that is completely blocked
by tokens of other companies.

A route of a train can terminate
at either a city, a town, or an off-board area.

A route may contain two revenue locations
on the same hex.

Cities, towns and off-board areas
count toward the length of a route.

No two trains of a company may run on the same piece of track.

##### Train types

_N_ train: has a maximum route length of _N_.

D train: has no maximum route length.

#### Pay Dividends

The total revenue of all trains may be
* paid out to the share holders as dividend
* withheld in the company treasury

When dividends are paid out,
shares in the open market
pay out to the company.

The share value moves
* 1 space left if no dividends are paid out
* 1 space right if dividends are paid out

#### Purchase Trains

A company may buy
* the next available train from the bank
* a train from the open market
* any train from another company

A company may buy multiple trains per turn.

A company may not buy a train
if it is at the train limit.

The D train may be bought at a discount
by trading in another train.
A company can do this even if it's at the train limit.
The traded-in train is placed in the open market.

Trains that are discarded because of a lowered train limit
are placed in the open market. 

##### Forced Train Purchases

When a company has no train,
and it has a valid route,
it must buy a train.

If the company does not have enough money to buy a train,
they must buy the cheapest available train from the bank or open market,
or a train from another company for no more than face value.

In this case, the president must help pay for the train.
They must sell shares if necessary.

Selling shares may not lead to a change in presidency
in the currently operating railroad company.

If the president cannot raise enough cash to pay for the train,
they are bankrupt.
