Minimum bid is face value, minimum raise is 5.

If no player bids on a private company,
it is removed from the game.

After each auction, the priority deal is passed to the next player
in player order.

The player with the most cash remaining after all auctions
receives the priority deal.


## Stock Dealing Rounds

During their turn,
a player can take the following actions, in order (all optional):
* sell certificates
* either start a company,
or buy one share

### Buying

When buying a share from a company,
the player pays the current market value
to the company.

When buying a share from the open market,
the player pays the current market value
to the bank.

A player may own up to 60% of the shares of a company.

A player may not buy a share of a company
of which they have sold a share earlier this SDR.

### Selling

Players may not sell shares
before the company has operated.

The president's share may not be sold to the open market.
The open market may hold up to 50% of the shares of a company.

When a player sells shares,
the share value of the company moves 1 space down for each 10% sold.
If the seller is not the president of the company,
the share value will not drop through a ledge.

### Certificate limit

A player may not buy a share that would take them
over the certificate limit.

If a player owns more certificates than the certificate limit,
they must sell shares until they comply with the certificate limit
in their next SDR turn.

Private company certificates
count towards the certificate limit.

### Starting a company

To start a company,
a player buys a number of shares equal to the current phase
in a single SDR turn.
The player chooses the starting share value of the company
from the options indicated on the stock market chart.

the other shares are available.

A railroad company floats immediately
when the initial shares have been sold.

The other shares are placed in its treasury.
The home token is placed
at the start of the company's turn in the next operating round.

### Presidentship

If at any time a player has more shares of a company
than that company's president,
they become the president of that company.

They exchange two share certificates for the president's certificate,
and receive the company charter.

If two players have more shares than the president,
and have an equal number of shares,
the first player in player order after the former president
becomes the new president.

### End of SDR

The SDR ends when
all players pass
in consecutive turns.

receives the priority deal.
